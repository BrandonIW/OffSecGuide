With SUID and SGID, we're basically looking for binaries that will execute as root or another privledged user. These are recognized by the below permissions:

4777 2777 1777 -> SUID, SGID, Sticky bit
rws-xxx-xxx, rwx-rws-xxx

Or, search w/ find:
find / -perm -u=s -type f -exec ls -lah {} \; 2>/dev/null


If a file is running as root when a standard user runs it, we can possibly take advantage of it:
1) Check gtfo bins (https://gtfobins.github.io/)
2) If the binary is calling another binary via $PATH, we can create a binary that we want to run as root as toss it in $PATH at the beginning. See SUID & $PATH


*** ALWAYS run sudo -l to see what we're able to run as sudo as the user we're using currently ***
