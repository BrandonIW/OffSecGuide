#----Overview
Webpages that allow users to upload data, such as photos, blogs etc. May be able to upload shells, overwrite files, bypass client and/or svr filtering

#----Overwriting Existing Files
On the off-chance that a webpage is writeable by a user, we can overwrite existing files when uploading. One method is by looking @ the src code html and trying to determine where existing files may be located and what their naming convention is. Uploading w/ same name/location may overwrite

#---RCE
Uploading malicious data that the back-end understands, often php, python or js. Often uses webshells or revshells.
