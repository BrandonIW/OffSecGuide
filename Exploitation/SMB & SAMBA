* smbclient

- For misconfigured/anonymous logins allowed, we can exploit w/ simple smbclient w/ known U&P or Anonymous login. For example:
smbclient -U <Username> //<TARGET IP>/<Share Name> -p <Port>
smbclient --pw-nt-hash <NT Hash> -> Pass-the-hash attk if we have the NT hash of user 

- Once inside a share, smb commands may be available to further exploit. Examples.
ls
cd <dir>
mget <file1> <file2> -> Download multiple files
get <file1> -> Download one file
put <file1> -> Upload one file
mput <file1> <file2> -> Upload multiple files
more <file> 
tar c all.tar -> Package all files recursively from current dir. into local tar file
exit
!<cmd> -> run local cmds while connection via smbclient
