#----Host Discovery Basics
Remember the typical ARP across Networks:
1) PC1 realizes ARP recipient of <IP> isn't on its subnet
2) ARP Request to Router to find MAC of default gateway (if not already cached)
3) Default gateway replies w/ ARP Reply w/ it's default gateway
4) PC1 sends ping to <IP> w/ router's MAC as destination
5) Router strips L2 header, but L3 is still destined to <IP>
6) Router ARP's for the MAC of <IP>
7) Router recieves ARP reply and fwd's the Packet from PC1 to <IP> w/ appropriate MAC address 

Host Discovery via ICMP:
ICMP works @ L3, so ARP queries will always precede ICMP echo requests if the IP isn't already cached. 
- However, new MS OS block ICMP by default in Windows firewall. 

Host Discovery via TCP/UDP
Simply takes adv. of the 3-way handshake to see if we get a SYN/ACK in reply to a SYN. 

* Nmap - Common tool for port enumeration

Switches:
-sS -> TCP Half Scan (In Wireshark you'll see SYN > SYN/ACK > RST) Avoid logging by IDS/IPS as no full TCP handshake is completed. Default. Open if recieves SYN/ACK
-sU -> UDP Scan (Slower than TCP as it will need to wait for a timeout if closed)
-sT -> Full TCP Connect Scan (leaves log/footprint)
-sV -> Detect Service Version
-sX -> Xmas Scan (If no return, open or filtered)
-sF -> FIN Scan (If no return, open or filtered)
-sN -> NULL Scan (If no return, open or filtered)
-PR -sn -> Only perform ARP Queries to determine if a host is alive. Do not scan ports afterwards (-sn). 
-PE -sn -> Only perform ICMP Echo Queries to determine if a host is alive. Do not scan ports afterwards (-sn). 
-PP -sn -> Only perform ICMP Timestamp Queries to determine if a host is alive. Do not scan ports afterwards (-sn). 
-PM -sn -> Only perform ICMP Mask Queries to determine if a host is alive. Do not scan ports afterwards (-sn). 
-PA<ports> i.e. -PA80,443,8080 -PA21-25 -PA22 -> Only send TCP ACK. If we get a RST back, it's open, because the recipient is recieving an ACK to a connection that's not open, so we get a RST in return. 
-O -> Detect OS
-A -> Aggressive (OS, service version, tracert)
-v/-vv/-vvv -> Verbosity
-p 80-100 / -p- -> Choose ports (-p- = all ports)
--top-ports 1000 -> Scan top 1000 ports
-oA -> Save results in XML/Normal/Script Kiddie output

Useful Usages:
nmap -sV -sC --script vuln <IP>  -> Scan for Low Hanging Fruit Vulns
nmap -sL 10.10.0-255.101-125 -> Lists all the IPs that would be scanned, but it wont actually scan them
