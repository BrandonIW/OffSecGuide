1) Whois
Whois is a protocol on port 43, used by Whois servvers responsible for responding to whois queries with information about the domain. This information includes:
- Registrar: Which registrar was the domain name registered under?
- Contact Info of registrant: Name, phone, email etc.
- Creation & expiration dates of the domain. When does it need to be renewed
- Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve this domain's name

Examples:
whois tryhackme.com
whois yahoo.com 


2) Nslookup

Examples:
nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 8.8.8.8 --> Lookup A records for tryhackme, using google'd DNS servers
nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com --> Find MX records for a domain, using default DNS servers on the system
nslookup.exe -type=TXT quicktech.ca  --> Find TXT records. Can be helpful because now we know they use spamtitan for example.

3) Dig

The syntax is different. dig DOMAIN_NAME RECORD_TYPE
You will get far more verbose output with dig. Generally better than nslookup 

Examples:
dig tryhackme.com MX
