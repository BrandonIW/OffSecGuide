1) Whois
Whois is a protocol on port 43, used by Whois servvers responsible for responding to whois queries with information about the domain. This information includes:
- Registrar: Which registrar was the domain name registered under?
- Contact Info of registrant: Name, phone, email etc.
- Creation & expiration dates of the domain. When does it need to be renewed
- Name Server: Which server to ask to resolve this domain's name

Examples:
whois tryhackme.com
whois yahoo.com 


2) Nslookup

Examples:
nslookup -type=A tryhackme.com 8.8.8.8 --> Lookup A records for tryhackme, using google'd DNS servers
nslookup -type=MX tryhackme.com --> Find MX records for a domain, using default DNS servers on the system
nslookup.exe -type=TXT quicktech.ca  --> Find TXT records. Can be helpful because now we know they use spamtitan for example.

3) Dig

The syntax is different. dig DOMAIN_NAME RECORD_TYPE
You will get far more verbose output with dig. Generally better than nslookup 

Examples:
dig tryhackme.com MX


4) DNSDumpster
Onlien service that looks for subdomains, such as webmail.tryhackme.com, support.tryhackme.com etc. etc. DNSDumpster also returns the typical A/MX records etc. etc. Remember that with webmail.comtryhackme.com -> ".com" is top level domain, "tryhackme" is second-level domain and "webmail" is subdomain


5) Shodan.io
Online database that collects information on anything that connects to the internet. Can be very nice for finding trends like the most common port used for Apache, etc. ALso shows headers returned from a IP's open ports, basically responses to Shodan's queries to get information
