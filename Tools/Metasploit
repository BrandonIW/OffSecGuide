#-----OVERVIEW
Exploitation Framework. Allows for easy exploit searching, packaging and execution of exploits and payloads

#-----MODULES
Categorization of tools within the M.S. toolbelt
1) Auxillery - Supporting modules that are not exploit-related. e.g. Scanners, Web Crawlers
2) Encoders - Allows you to encode an exploid or payload to avoid sig. detection. Simple obfuscation
3) Evasion - Modules that attempt to directly evade AV
4) Exploits - Organized exploits per system e.g. Android, Windows, Unix etc.
5) Payloads - The binary that will actually be responsible for performing the naughty action e.g. create rev shell, or run calc.exe as a proof of concept.
- Singles: Self-contained payloads. Do not need anything additional for them to run
- Stagers: Payloads that setup a communication channel b/t M.S. and the victim. Basically a very small payload that sets the stage for larger payloads later
- These can be distinguished via a "_" character in the name. shell_reverse_tcp = Single Payload, whereas, shell/reverse_tcp = Stager 
6) Post - Post-exploit Modules

#-----BASIC CMDS and USAGE
help
history
use <exploit>
search <keyword>
searchsploit <keyword> -> Search exploitdb
search type:exploit <keyword>
search platform:windows <keyword>
show options
show payloads 
show targets
info -> Shows verbose info related to w/e context we've currently selected i.e. we select an exploit, and we can show info regarding that exploit
run 
set <parameter> <value>
unset <parameter>
unset all
check -> Can do a prelim. check to see if the target is vuln before running
background -> Sends current session to b/g
sessions -> View all sessions
sessions -i # -> Foreground chosen session

#-----Enumeration & Scanners
Within auxiliary module, there are a number of scanner and enumerators e.g.
/scanner/discovery/udp_sweep
/scanner/smb/smb_version
/scanner/smb/smb_enumshares
/smb/scanner/smb/smb.login

Other tools are probably better, but these exist if needed.
