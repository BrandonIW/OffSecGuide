#----OVERVIEW
Linux system enumeration for various misconfigurations and things that may lead to priv. escl.

#----ADD. Notes
Linenum (https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum)
Must be run on the target system we're interested in.

linenum -e <outputfile.txt> -t -k <keyword> -> enumerate linux system, additionally search all files for a specific keyword, do a slow scan (-t) and output results

Linpeas (https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)
Looks nicer. Colour coded
