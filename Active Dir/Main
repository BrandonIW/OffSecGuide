#----Enumeration Techniques
1) Obviously Nmap

2) enum4linux can be useful if SMB/SAMBA share is available. Can retrieve:
- NetBIOS Name
- Domain Name
- Share Enumeration
- SID
- User Enumeration

3) Kerbrute: If Kerberos is running as a service on our target for Auth, Kerbrute is a tool allowing for brute force discovery of U & P. However, there are likely account lockout policies in place if we should fail login numerous times
- kerbute userenum -> Enumerates Valid Domain Names
- kerbrute bruteforce -> Brute force U:P combos
- kerbrute bruteuser -> Brtueforce a single user's password from a wordlisthttps://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sq00ky/attacktive-directory-tools/master/passwordlist.txt

Example Commands:
/kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum userlist.txt --dc 10.10.182.23 -d spookysec.local -> BF usernames from a given userlist on a target DC and domain 
/kerbrute_linux_amd64 [command] --help -> Gets help on a cmd

#----Exploit Techniques
1) ASREPRoasting - This occurs whena  user account has a priviledge level of "Does not require Pre-auth" meaning it does not need to provide valid identification to request a Kerberos ticket on that account. 
- To take advantage of this, we can use a tool called GetNPUsers.py from within the Impacket tool. 
- The only requirements is valid usernames, which we enumerated w/ Kerbrute.
- python3 GetNPUsers.py <domain>/<username> -dc-ip <IP address> -> If the user does not need to provide valid ID, then we will be returned a Kerberos Hash of that user's password
- We can then crack w/ Hashcat using the appropriate mode  https://hashcat.net/wiki/doku.php?id=example_hashes i.e. 
sudo hashcat -a 0 -m 18200 hashfile.txt ~/Downloads/passwordlist.txt


#----Priv. Escal. 
10 secretsdump.py - Allows for the retrieval of all password hashes that this user account has access to. If the account we specify has access to hashes in AD, we can pull these out. So for example if we know the password of a backup acct or smth that has fairly high priv. or access to hashes, we can pivot from there to the hash for admin 
- python3 secretsdump.py <username>@<IP of DC> -> Grabs the hashes associated on the DC. Can then use smth like Evil WinRM to pass the hash or crack
